Mocha discord bot

### Notes
To actually get things to work you need to install a few things of which include:
* Latest Python [download ](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python downloads page") 
* [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "Discord API documentation") (Just copy the command " py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py" into Command Prompt after installing Python)
* Any Python IDE (Personally I prefer [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/ "VSCode download page"))
