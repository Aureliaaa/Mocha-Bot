# Mocha-Bot
Mocha is a general purpose discord bot that primarily focuses on general and fun commands without much in the way of moderation. There are many planned features such as:
* Extended action commands to sate your desire to nuzzles your discord homies
* More fun/troll commands in case you feel the need to be uhh *excessively humorous*
* Possibility of a marriage system...
* and many more to come! (when I get some more ideas)

### Notes
To actually get things to work you need to install a few things of which include:
* Latest Python [download ](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python downloads page") 
* [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "Discord API documentation") (Just copy the command ``py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py`` into Command Prompt after installing Python)
* Any Python IDE (Personally I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/ "VSCode download page"))
